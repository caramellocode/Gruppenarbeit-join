                    <h2 id="m2427">Applicable Legal Bases</h2>
                    <p><strong>Applicable legal bases under the GDPR: </strong>Below, you will find an overview of the
                        legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that, in addition to the
                        provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations in your or our country of residence
                        or establishment may apply. Furthermore, if specific legal bases are applicable in individual
                        cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR)</strong> The data subject has given consent to the
                            processing of their personal data for one or more specific purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Contractual Performance and Pre-contractual Inquiries (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR)</strong>
                            Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a
                            party or for the execution of pre-contractual measures at the request of the data subject.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR)</strong> Processing is necessary to
                            protect the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except where such
                            interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data
                            subject requiring the protection of personal data.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>National Data Protection Regulations in Germany:</strong> In addition to the data
                        protection regulations of the GDPR, there are national data protection regulations in Germany.
                        This includes, in particular, the Law for the Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data
                        Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz - BDSG). The BDSG contains specific provisions regarding the
                        right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, the processing of special
                        categories of personal data, processing for other purposes, and transmission, as well as
                        automated decision-making on an individual basis, including profiling. Furthermore, state data
                        protection laws of individual federal states may also apply.</p>
                    <p><strong>Reference to the Applicability of GDPR and Swiss Data Protection Act:</strong> These data
                        protection notices serve both to provide information in accordance with the Swiss Federal Act on
                        Data Protection (Schweizer DSG) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this
                        reason, please note that, for the sake of broader spatial applicability and understanding, the
                        terms of the GDPR are used. In particular, the terms "processing" of "personal data,"
                        "legitimate interest," and "special categories of data" as used in the GDPR are used instead of
                        the terms used in the Swiss DSG. However, the legal meaning of these terms is determined within
                        the scope of the Swiss DSG's applicability in accordance with the Swiss DSG.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2>
                    <p>According to legal requirements and considering the state of the art, implementation costs, the
                        nature, scope, context, and purposes of processing, as well as the varying likelihood and
                        severity of risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we implement suitable technical
                        and organizational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                    <p>These measures include, in particular, securing the confidentiality, integrity, and availability
                        of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as related access,
                        input, disclosure, availability, and separation. Additionally, we have established procedures to
                        ensure the exercise of data subject rights, data deletion, and responses to data breaches.
                        Furthermore, we consider data protection during the development or selection of hardware,
                        software, and processes, following the principles of data protection by design and by default.
                    </p>

                    <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>Data Processing in Third Countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e., outside the
                        European Union (EU) or the European Economic Area (EEA)) or if processing occurs within the use
                        of third-party services or the disclosure or transmission of data to other individuals,
                        entities, or companies, it is done in accordance with legal requirements. If the data protection
                        level in the third country has been recognized through an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this
                        serves as the basis for data transfers. Otherwise, data transfers only occur when the data
                        protection level is otherwise ensured, especially through standard contractual clauses (Art.
                        46(2)(c) GDPR), explicit consent, or in the case of contractual or legally required transfers
                        (Art. 49(1) GDPR). Additionally, we will inform you about the foundations of third-country
                        transfers with individual providers from the third country, with adequacy decisions being the
                        primary basis. Information about third-country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be
                        found in the offering of the EU Commission: <a

                    </p>

                    <p>EU-US Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework: Within the framework of the so-called "Data Privacy
                        Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognized the data protection level as safe for
                        certain companies in the USA through an adequacy decision dated July 10, 2023. The list of
                        certified companies and further information about the DPF can be found on the website of the
                        U.S. Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/"
                            target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/</a>. We will inform you in the data
                        protection notices about which service providers certified under the Data Privacy Framework are
                        used by us.</p>

                    <h2 id="m10">Rights of Data Subjects</h2>
                    <p>Rights of Data Subjects under the GDPR: You, as data subjects, have various rights under the

                            provisions. If personal data concerning you is processed for direct marketing purposes, you
                            have the right to object at any time to the processing of personal data concerning you for
                            such marketing, including profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct
                            marketing.</li>
                        <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent: </strong>You have the right to withdraw your consent at

                        <li><strong>Right to Rectification: </strong>You have the right to request the completion of
                            data concerning you or the rectification of inaccurate data concerning you in accordance

                            that data to another controller.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complaint to a Supervisory Authority: </strong>Without prejudice to any other
                            administrative or judicial remedy, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a
                            supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of your habitual residence, your
                            place of work, or the place of the alleged infringement, if you consider that the processing
                            of personal data relating to you violates the provisions of the GDPR.</li>
